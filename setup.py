    PlanetHoster API

    | <a href=\"https://apidoc.planethoster.com/fr\">Version Française</a> ## Description The PlanetHoster API allows actions related to domain management and web hosting. ## Details - SSL only: we require that all requests be done over encrypted TLS/SSL connections. - Supported HTTP verbs are GET and POST. If your client does not support all HTTP verbs, you can override the verb with X-Http-Method-Override HTTP header. - Unless otherwise specified in the method documentation, all successful API calls return an **HTTP code 200** with a JSON object. - Errors are returned with an HTTP code 4XX or 5XX, a JSON object with properties \"error\" (an error message) and an \"error_code\" (optional, an integer). - Every string passed to and from the API needs to be UTF-8 encoded. - The API sends ETag headers and supports the If-None-Match header. - Unless otherwise specified, all API methods require authentication with api_user and api_key.  ## Authentication and whitelist 1. In order to be able to contact the API, you must whitelist your IPs. 2. API user and API key are required in the HTTP header.  Whitelisted IP and credentials can be found in the <a href=\"https://my.planethoster.com/domain-reseller\" target=\"_blank\">PlanetHoster Client Area / Reseller section</a>.  <SecurityDefinitions />   # noqa: E501
